Big Title
#########

You can definitly have a look at the source, but since you are here you are looking for more.

This is an original theme for `pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_,
built using:

- `foundation css framework <http://foundation.zurb.com/>`_ to ease the pain and
  learn the basics which are not very different from twitter bootstrap and for which 
  there is actually a 
  `documentation <http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/joyride.php>`_ with live
  demos.
- The font used for the titles is the awesome open source 
  `League Gothic <https://github.com/theleagueof/league-gothic>`_,
- I also use `animate.css <https://github.com/daneden/animate.css>`_.
- `slabText <http://www.frequency-decoder.com/demo/slabText/>`_ is used to
  render the big titles
- `mansonry <http://masonry.desandro.com/index.html>`_ to render the index pages
- the background is from `subtle patterns <http://subtlepatterns.com/>`_

Like Tupac says «Keep your head up!»
